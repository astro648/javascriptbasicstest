# JavaScript Basics Project
This project was to help introduce the basics of JavaScript to me.
I mainly used the script tag in HTML so even though it shows HTML 93%, most of the JS code was inside the script tag in HTML.
## What I did
Console.log test, console.log concatenation of two variables using two different methods, finding the length of a variable, replacing specific text in a variable, and decapitalization of a variable.
